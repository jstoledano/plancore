# PlanCore

**PlanCore** is a backend governance engine that models organizational commitments as explicit, enforceable domain objects.

Rather than managing workflows or approvals, PlanCore focuses on **correctness over time**. Every plan represents a formal commitment that must be executed, verified, and closed according to strict invariants. If those conditions are not met, the system does not allow closure.

PlanCore was extracted and evolved from a long-lived Integrated Management System operating under real regulatory and operational constraints. Its design reflects years of sustained use, repeated audits, and organizational change, where ambiguity and manual enforcement proved insufficient.
